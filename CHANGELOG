  1 Dec 2011 V0.8.2 Fixed an incorrect error diagnostic which when output
                      prematurely ended processing; switched to a different
                      Python library for running linkern in a "subprocess"
                      so as to support current versions of Python on Windows 7
                      (thanks to Peter Vancorenland for diagnosing the issue,
                      researching a fix, and testing it!)
  7 Mar 2012 V0.8.3 Build the tour file in the user's temporary file directory.
                      This avoids issues with file permissions on some systems
                      where it's most convenient to run tspart.py from within
                      a specific directory that the user may not have write
                      access to.  Note that other temporary files were already
                      being written (and then removed) from the temp. directory.
                      For purposes of debugging, the tour file was being
                      written to the current working directory.  That is no
                      longer done.
  26 Apr 2016 v?    Updated code for Python3  Removed 'build-concorde-osx.sh' in
                      favor of running `brew install homebrew/science/concorde`
                      Removed unused code.  Rewrite for readability and simplicity.
                      Updated Readme.
